 * Dim over everything behind a modal. This is real alpha compositing — the terminal
 * cell keeps its character and its colours are blended toward black, so the editor
 * stays legible underneath while clearly reading as inactive. Verified: white text
 * under a 0.45 scrim comes out around #8c8c8c rather than being painted over.
 *
 * Black at partial alpha rather than a theme colour, because it has to recede on a
 * light palette as well as a dark one.
