/**
 * File operations that report progress instead of freezing the editor.
 *
 * `fs.rmSync(node_modules, { recursive: true })` is one call that takes tens of
 * seconds and blocks the loop for all of it: no repaint, no spinner, nothing to
 * tell you the editor is alive rather than hung. These walk the top level of
 * each target instead, doing one entry at a time and handing the loop back
 * between them, so a status line can count up while the work runs.
 *
 * Entry granularity, not file: recursing to every leaf of a 100 000-file tree
 * costs far more than letting the OS delete a package directory in one go, and
 * a few hundred ticks is already a smooth-looking count.
